# Scope

The FDC3 Standard specifies protocols and taxonomies to advance the ability of desktop applications in financial workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion, without prior bi-lateral agreements.

Financial desktop applications include any app used in common financial workflows:

* Traditional native applications implemented in C++, .NET, Java, Python, etc.
* Hybrid web/native applications - stand alone native apps embedding Chromium (e.g. Electron, CEF, NW.js)
* Desktop web applications - platform based apps extending Chromium (e.g. OpenFin, Finsemble, Glue42)
* Common desktop applications not specific to finance, but critical to workflows - such as Excel, Outlook, etc.
* PWAs & Web applications running in a commercial browser

This standards group is focused specifically on the desktop, hence, its activities do not include:

* Defining financial objects - where existing standards are well established
* Interoperability between mobile apps
* Interoperability via REST or other client to server communication, except where used locally for Desktop Agents to communicate with each other in support of desktop interoperability (Agent Bridging)

Note: While these areas are out of scope, compatibility with Mobile and/or REST are still valid points of consideration for the FDC3 Standard.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
