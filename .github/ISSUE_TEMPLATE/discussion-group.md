## Meeting notices
- FINOS **Project leads** are responsible for observing the FINOS guidelines for [running project meetings](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/meeting-procedures/). Project maintainers can find additional resources in the [FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet](https://community.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet).

- **All participants** in FINOS project meetings are subject to the [LF Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), the [FINOS Community Code of Conduct](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/code-of-conduct) and all other [FINOS policies](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#policies).

- FINOS meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of FINOS and the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws. Please contact legal@finos.org with any questions.

- FINOS project meetings may be recorded for use solely by the FINOS team for administration purposes. In very limited instances, and with explicit approval, recordings may be made more widely available.
  
- A Discussion Group has no direct decision-making power regarding the FDC3 standard - rather it is intended that anything they propose or work on will result in proposals (via Github issues and PRs) for the Standards Working Group participants to consider and vote on for inclusion in the standard.
